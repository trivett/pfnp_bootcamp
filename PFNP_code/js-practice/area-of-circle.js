/******************
Area of A Circle

Write a function called areaOfaCircle()

The function will calculate the area of circle
It will take one argument which will be the radius
This is the formula to calculate the area of a circle:
A = π * r2, where is π is Pi and r is the radius squared
******************/


function areaOfaCircle(radius){
  const pi = 3.141952654;
  let r2 = radius ** 2;
  let response = pi * r2;
  return response;
}
